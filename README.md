# minecraft-checker
This Project checks if a minecraft account is a nfa/sfa account or invalid it also says you if the ip you are using is shadow banned from minecraft (shadow bann is if you send too many login attempts to minecraft then minecraft will say that every account is invalid even if it is valid)


## How to set it up
 1. download the checker.py file
 2. install python if you dont have already python installed (click add python to part in the installer) 
 3. open your cmd and type pip install requests
 4. input a valid minecraft account in the fiel INPUT A MINECRAFT ACCOUNT WHICH IS ALWAYS VALID
 5. start the programm
 6. input the combo you want to check

### How it works

it works by havin one minecraft account which is always valid then programm the programm checks the given combo and if it is invalid then it checks the combo which is always valid if that combo gets shown as invalid then it will return shadow banned proxy


## i dont take any responsibility for damage done with the programm it's for educational purposes only and its just a proove of concept of how it would be possible to detect if mojang shadow banns you do not use this programm for account cracking
